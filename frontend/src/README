# PostFlow

**PostFlow** is a social media quote-sharing application that allows users to explore, create, and save inspirational quotes. Users can browse quotes from the global feed, post their own quotes, and save their favorite quotes to their personal profile — similar to the way TikTok users can like and save videos.

## Features

* **Explore Quotes:** Browse quotes from all users in the feed, newest first.
* **Create Quotes:** Users can post their own quotes directly from the feed.
* **Save Favorites:** Users can save quotes from the feed to their profile for later.
* **User Profiles:** Each user has a personal profile page displaying their saved quotes.
* **Pagination:** Display quotes in pages of 10 with a "Next" button for smooth browsing.
* **Backend CRUD Operations:** Full support for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for posts and favorites.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React, React Router, CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express
* **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
* **APIs:** REST endpoints for quotes and favorites
